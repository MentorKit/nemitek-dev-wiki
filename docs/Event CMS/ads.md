# Ads

Nemitek has also instructed us to set up ads on the event pages. The ads are delivered through the company adnunitus and employee Stian Remaad, [see email thread](https://app.sparkmailapp.com/web-share/Zynp6GNd020sUval1jmcaMi28ZLnOUYym0HI-Whm).   
This was done to set this up. 

1. We have applied a Beaver Themer layout to set up the sidebars and top bars for placing ads. Custom CSS must be applied to ensure width in a main content column of 1088px. The CSS is stored in the Beaver Themer layout.   
2. Then we have placed the Adnuntius javascript script in the head section of the theme.   
3. Then we place HTML scripts where we would like the ads to display. See the email thread for javascript and html snippets.
